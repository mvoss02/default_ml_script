This repo will contain a default modeling script (for ML models). Including GridSearch with cross-validation, modeling pipelines and model saving.Later I will add the full MLOps workthrough.
I am using the NY Taxi data. Note, however, that the focus does not lie on the model perfromance, but rathe ron the steps needed to setup an MLOps pipeline.

The data can be obtained from this link: https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
